+# Project Setup Guide
++This guide explains how to install dependencies for both the backend and frontend and which tests to run before committing code.
+
+## Backend
+
+1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
+2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
+   ```bash
+   python3 -m venv .venv
+   source .venv/bin/activate
+   ```
+3. Install required packages:
+   ```bash
+   pip install -r requirements.txt
+   ```
+4. Run unit tests:
+   ```bash
+   pytest
+   ```
+
+## Frontend
+
+1. Make sure you have **Node.js 18** installed.
+2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
+3. Install packages:
+   ```bash
+   npm install
+   ```
+4. Run linting and tests:
+   ```bash
+   npm run lint && npm test
+   ```
+
+Running `pytest` for the backend and `npm run lint && npm test` for the frontend is recommended before every commgiit.
